Electron Microscopy,EM,"Transmission electron microscopy is a microscopy technique that detects the scatter of electrons through a thin specimen, providing higher resolution images than other microscopy techniques."
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay,ELISA,Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay
ELISPOT,ELISPOT,Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Spot
Functional Assay,FA,"Use of a cell-surface targeted antibody to induce, modify, or block a biological response. Can also be applied to the use of a product to measure a functional activity within a cell."
Flow Cytometry,FC,Flow cytometric analysis of antibody surface-stained cells.
Intracellular Staining for Flow Cytometry,ICFC,Flow cytometric analysis of intracellularly-stained cells.
Immunocytochemistry,ICC,"Immunocytochemistry is a technique used to assess the presence of a specific protein or antigen in cells (cultured cells, cell suspensions) by use of specific antibodies, thereby allowing visualization and examination under a microscope. The readout can be colorimetric using chromogen substrate or fluorescent using fluorophore-conjugated antibodies."
Immunofluorescence Microscopy,IF,"Microscopic examination of fluorescently-labeled cells, either grown on or spun onto slides, or tissue preparations."
Immunohistochemistry,IHC,"Analysis of antibody-labeled tissue preparations, typically frozen or paraffin-embedded."
3D Immunohistochemistry,3D IHC,"Immunodetection applied to formalin-fixed tissue sections of at least 300 microns in thickness, which are optically cleared by tissue clearing reagent."
